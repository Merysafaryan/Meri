# 2. Data Collection,Integration, and Analysis

**2.1 Data Collection Implementation**

Generating Random Numbers:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() { 
    srand(time(NULL));
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        int randomNumber = rand() % 100;  // Generates a random number between 0 and 99
        printf("Random Number %d: %d\n", i + 1, randomNumber);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Simulating Sensor Data
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {

    srand(time(NULL));
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        double sensorReading = (double)rand() / RAND_MAX * 10.0; 
        printf("Sensor Reading %d: %.2f\n", i + 1, sensorReading);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Collecting User Input
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    // Collecting static data from user input
    int userAge;
    printf("Enter your age: ");
    scanf("%d", &userAge);
    printf("User Age: %d\n", userAge);

    return 0;
}
```
Static Data Initialization:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    // Static data initialization
    int staticArray[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    printf("Static Array Elements: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(staticArray) / sizeof(staticArray[0]); ++i) {
        printf("%d ", staticArray[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```
**2.2 Data Integration**

In the provided C code for the library management system, two main data structures are used to store and manage collected data: `struct Book` and `struct Student`. Let's discuss these structures and the justification for choosing them.

 1.struct Book

```c
struct Book {
    char name[30];
    char author[30];
    int id;
    struct Book* next;
};
```
Explanation:
- struct Book is designed to represent a book in the library.
- It contains fields for the name of the book (name), the author of the book (author), a unique identifier for the book (id), and a pointer to the next book in the linked list (next).
- This structure is used to create a linked list of books in the library.

Justification:
- Linked lists are chosen to manage the collection of books dynamically. This allows for efficient memory usage as the size of the library can grow or shrink during runtime.
- The `struct Book` encapsulates related information about a book in a single unit, making it easy to manage and manipulate book data.
  
 2. struct Student

```c
struct Student {
    char name[30];
    int id;
    struct Student* next;
};
```

Explanation:
- struct Student represents a student in the library.
- It includes fields for the student's name (name), a unique identifier for the student (id), and a pointer to the next student in the linked list (next).
- Similar to struct Book, this structure is used to create a linked list of students who have borrowed books.

Justification:
- Using a linked list for students provides a dynamic and efficient way to manage student records. Students can be added or removed from the system without the need for a fixed-size array.
- The structure contains the necessary information about a student, and the linked list allows for easy traversal and manipulation of student records.

**2.3 Data Analysis**
```c 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>

// Function to calculate the mean of an array
double calculateMean(int arr[], int size) {
    double sum = 0.0;

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }

    return sum / size;
}

// Function to calculate the median of an array
double calculateMedian(int arr[], int size) {
    // Sort the array
    qsort(arr, size, sizeof(int), compare);

    // If the size is odd, return the middle element
    if (size % 2 != 0) {
        return arr[size / 2];
    }
    // If the size is even, return the average of the two middle elements
    else {
        return (arr[size / 2 - 1] + arr[size / 2]) / 2.0;
    }
}

// Function to compare integers for qsort
int compare(const void *a, const void *b) {
    return (*(int *)a - *(int *)b);
}

// Function to calculate the mode of an array
int calculateMode(int arr[], int size) {
    // Sort the array
    qsort(arr, size, sizeof(int), compare);

    int currentNum = arr[0];
    int currentCount = 1;
    int maxCount = 1;
    int mode = arr[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == currentNum) {
            currentCount++;
        } else {
            if (currentCount > maxCount) {
                maxCount = currentCount;
                mode = currentNum;
            }

            currentNum = arr[i];
            currentCount = 1;
        }
    }

    return mode;
}

// Function to calculate the standard deviation of an array
double calculateStandardDeviation(int arr[], int size) {
    double mean = calculateMean(arr, size);
    double sumSquaredDiff = 0.0;

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        sumSquaredDiff += pow(arr[i] - mean, 2);
    }

    return sqrt(sumSquaredDiff / size);
}

int main() {
    int data[] = {5, 2, 7, 4, 8, 6, 1, 3};
    int size = sizeof(data) / sizeof(data[0]);

    printf("Mean: %.2f\n", calculateMean(data, size));
    printf("Median: %.2f\n", calculateMedian(data, size));
    printf("Mode: %d\n", calculateMode(data, size));
    printf("Standard Deviation: %.2f\n", calculateStandardDeviation(data, size));

    return 0;
}
```
